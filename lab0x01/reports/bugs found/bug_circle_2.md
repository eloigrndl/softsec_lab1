# BUG-CIRCLE-2
## Category
Unchecked system call returning code

## Description
The `store_png` function is called but the return value is not checked.

## Affected Lines in the original program
`circle.c:93`

## Expected vs Observed
The resulting image should have been stored correctly but this is not the case as the `store_png` function failed. The program should have returned a return code indeicating an error but this is also not the case.

## Steps to Reproduce

If `bug_circle_0` is not fixed, the program will fail because of the type error.

### Command
```
./circle ./test_imgs/ck.png /inexistant/folder/test_circle.png 100 100 50 FFFFFFF
```

### Proof-of-Concept Input (if needed)

## Suggested Fix Description
The return value should be checked and if the function has failed, we should print an error message and return an error code.
